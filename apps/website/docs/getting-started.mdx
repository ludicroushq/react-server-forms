import { Banner } from "fumadocs-ui/components/banner";

## Prerequisites

At the moment, only `Next.js` with `React 19` is supported.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-server-forms
```

For this example we'll be using DaisyUI + Tailwind and will assume that you have that set up. React Server Forms comes with a pre-built renderer for DaisyUI, which you can install with the following command:

```bash
npm install @react-server-forms/daisy-ui
```

## Setup

Create a `providers.tsx` file in your app folder. Here you will need to import or create a form renderer.

<Banner>
  You select from pre-built form renderers or create your own. See the [Form
  Renderer](/docs/form-renderer) docs to learn more.
</Banner>

```tsx
"use client";
import { createFormRenderer } from "@react-server-forms/daisy-ui";
import { ReactServerFormsProvider } from "react-server-forms/client";

const formRenderer = createFormRenderer();

export function Providers({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <ReactServerFormsProvider formRenderer={formRenderer}>
      {children}
    </ReactServerFormsProvider>
  );
}
```

Then update your root `layout.tsx` file to wrap your app in the `Providers` component.

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Usage

Let's create a simple newsletter signup form. We'll take a first name, last name, and email address.

### Form Schema

First we'll create a form schema.

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";
import { d } from "react-server-forms/schema";

export const formSchema = z
  .object({
    firstName: z
      .string()
      .min(1)
      .describe(d.Text({ label: "First Name" })),
    lastName: z
      .string()
      .min(1)
      .describe(d.Text({ label: "Last Name" })),
    email: z
      .string()
      .email()
      .min(1)
      .describe(d.Text({ label: "Email Address", type: "email" })),
  })
  .describe(d.Form({ submit: { label: "Lets go" } }));
```

`react-server-forms/schema` provides a `d` object that contains helpers to annotate your schema with input fields metadata.

### Form Action

```tsx
"use server";
import { createFormAction } from "react-server-forms/server";
import { formSchema } from "./schema";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export const formAction = createFormAction(formSchema, async ({ value }) => {
  console.log(value);
  redirect("/?success=true");
});
```

Typically it is best to redirect after the form action is complete, however you can also return JSON data and manage the form state on the client side.

### UI

Finally we'll wire up the UI. Since the entire app is wrapped with a formRenderer provider, your form code will be very minimal.

```tsx
"use client";
import { RenderForm } from "react-server-forms/client";
import { formSchema } from "./schema";
import { formAction } from "./actions";

export function Form() {
  return <RenderForm schema={formSchema} action={formAction} />;
}
```
